                <p>Mumbai: Stepping up his attack on the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on
                    Wednesday
                    tweeted an old video of late Sena founder Bal Thackeray in which the latter was seen saying the day
                    his party
                    comes to power, praying of namaz on roads will be stopped and loudspeakers from mosques will be
                    removed.

                    Raj Thackeray had on Tuesday urged people to play Hanuman Chalisa on loudspeakers on Wednesday
                    wherever they
                    hear loudspeakers "blaring azaan (Islamic prayer call)

                    In an open letter, the MNS leader had asked people to lodge complaint with police by dialling 100 if
                    they are
                    disturbed by the sound of 'azaan'.

                    In the 36-second video tweeted on Wednesday by the MNS chief, Bal Thackeray was seen draped in a
                    saffron shawl
                    with the Shiv Sena symbol in the background.

                    The Sena supremo was seen in the video saying, "The day my government comes to power, praying of
                    namaz will be
                    stopped because religion should be such that it doesn't create an impediment in national
                    development."

                    "If our Hindu religion is creating an impediment then tell me, I will take care of it...Loudspeakers
                    will be
                    removed from masjids," Bal Thackeray said in the old clip.
